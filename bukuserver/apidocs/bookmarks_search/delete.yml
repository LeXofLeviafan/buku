Delete all bookmarks matching the query
You can send a non-boolean value in a boolean field, but it is only considered truthy if converting it to a lowercase string produces **'true'**.

Special behaviour exists for the following combinations:
- **all_keywords** = _true_, **regex** = _false_, **keywords** = _blank_ (bookmarks with no title or no tags)
- **all_keywords** = _true_, **regex** = _false_, **keywords** = _immutable_ (bookmarks marked with **--immutable** flag)

#GET /api/bookmarks/search  {BookmarkSearch=}

tags: [Util]
consumes: ['application/x-www-form-urlencoded']

parameters:
  - name: all_keywords
    in: formData
    type: boolean
    description: "Exclude partial matches (with multiple keywords)."
  - name: deep
    in: formData
    type: boolean
    description: "Unless set to true, only _**full** words_ will be matched."
  - name: regex
    in: formData
    type: boolean
    description: "The keyword(s) are regular expressions (overrides other options)."
  - name: markers
    in: formData
    type: boolean
    description: |-
      When this is enabled, each keyword will be applied to a specific field based on prefix:
      * keywords starting with `.`, `>` or `:` will be searched for in _title_, _description_ and _URL_ respectively
      * `#` will be searched for in _tags_ (comma-separated, partial matches; not affected by **deep** value)
      * `#,` is the same but will match _**full** tags only_
      * `*` will be searched for in _all fields_ (implied if no prefix was provided)

  - name: keywords
    in: formData
    required: true
    collectionFormat: multi
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    example: ["global substring", ".title substring", ":url substring", ">description substring", "#partial,tags:", "#,exact,tags", "*another global substring"]
    description: "A set of terms to search for."
